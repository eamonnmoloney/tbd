## Being masters of collaberation
The software factory should have excellent collaberation as the highest ideal. For most of what software development is, comes down to
collaberation.

Consider the day process of creating code. The process, fundamentality is
- Have an idea
- Detail the idea enough so that a machine can work with that idea
- Write a list of instuctions that informs the machine what to do with the idea
- Deploy that instruction set into production

The purpose of this cycle is singular. To convert the work done during this cycle into money. The objective is to maximise the cost to revenue ratio. If we spend $100 to complete this cycle and earn $1000 from the product produced from the cycle. The ratio is 10:1. The better the idea and the shorter the cycle, the higher the ratio. Thats it. There is nothing else to the software factory. All processes, technologies, methodologies and practices serve only this purpose. To maximise this ratio.

## Long term vs short term
Of coarse, implicit in this ratio is a long term vs short term tradeoff. For the factory to succeed, you need to be open and transparent about where time horizon you are targeting as it will directly influence how you solve for maximising this ratio.

For example, if you want to optimise for short term, you can achieve maximised results by ignoring certain practices. Doing so will kill your long term plan and this is why you need to be clear about your time horizon.

**Note** It is close to imposibile to change from short to long term horizon. So be careful. This book addresses the long term only. The author has no time for
the destructive practices short term thinking places on individuals and society.

## The effects
This, in effect, is the purpose of the software factory. It few outcomes result from this description. The faster a factory can loop through this cycle, the more ideas they are give to the consumer for their product.

The speed limit of this cycle has resulted in a number of processes being promoted. For example,
- Scrum
- Continuous Delivery
- Testing
- Automonous Teams
- Technology Selection
- Technical Debt
- Asset Tracking
- Code Coverage
- Broad Strategy - Subscription vs Unit Sale
- Organisational Boundaries
- Work in progress
- Accumulated debt

The need to create faster cycles has lead to these and many more being pushed. In this book, we explore how these improve our system and suggest further improvements.

## The faster loop
Lets assume this cycle takes 1 year to complete. What does that mean for the output of the factory. On Janurary 1st, we start work gathering information about the idea. Some time later we decide we have enough detail to write a list of instructions that tell a machine what to do. After months of work, on December 31st,
we give the product is complete and it is made available for customers to buy.

Some issues stand out when the cycle is this long. 
- Financially, we need to pay our staff, equipment costs, internet bills, heating bills, electricity bills, etc. You get the picture. In effect, on the first day of sale, we are starting the sale of our new product in debt. And after a year of work, the debt is significant.
