## One line summary

Software development is drowning in buzzwords. Agile, Safe, Kanban, Less, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Integration, DevOps, DevSecOps, 
FinOps, Tribe, Squads, Code Review, Fast Feedback, Time to Market... The depth of knowledge necessary to fully internalise all this content
is extreme. This book argues, it is this complexity that leads to poorlyl operated software companies.

In this book I break out topics important to software development from first principles. These principles often originate from other industries
and have been adopted into software development in discuise. As an industry we are excellent at copy, paste and renaming ideas to look new
but they for the most part have existed for decades elsewhere.

The first priniciples approach will give the reader a base knowledge that allows them to understand why the concept of Agile works in theory, 
why scrum works in theory but both are simply branding over a core idea that, once understood, can be expanded to achieve better results than
they promise.
